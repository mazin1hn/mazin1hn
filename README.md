### 🔭 Currently Working On

Building a **production-grade Kubernetes platform on AWS (EKS)** with GitOps, secure delivery, and full observability.

- **Infrastructure:** Terraform modules for VPC, EKS, IAM, and security groups (remote state + locking)
- **Delivery:** GitHub Actions pipelines for Terraform deploys, Docker builds, and security gates (Checkov + Trivy)
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD + Helm for automated, declarative deployments
- **Ingress & HTTPS:** NGINX Ingress + Cert-Manager (Let’s Encrypt) for TLS
- **DNS Automation:** ExternalDNS for automatic record updates
- **Observability:** Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for cluster and app health
- **Secrets:** HashiCorp Vault for centralized secret management and rotation

Goal: ship an app reachable over **HTTPS** on a custom domain with a fully automated, secure workflow.
